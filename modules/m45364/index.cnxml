      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1171927790886">The OpenSurf function can be used to detect not only an object, but also its motion. As a result, by utilizing the OpenSurf function, we are able to track the dancing movements of a dancer who is wearing a hat and holding objects in her/his hands. As a result, the 3-D sound generated from the output of the OpenSurf function successfully describes those movements. Though work remains, our object detection and 3-D sound synthesis system can be used to help the blind experience the TV show Dancing With The Stars, as well as many other dancing performances.  </para>
