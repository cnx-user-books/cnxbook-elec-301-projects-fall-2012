    <para id="import-auto-id1166796291814">An important aspect of enjoying dancing is listening to the music with which the dancers are dancing. Incorporating this music into the sound synthesized by our project would be a great addition. Another improvement would be to increase the accuracy of object detection, because the current method of finding the object's center relies on averaging, and this is susceptible to outliers. The greatest improvement would be to do away with the requirement of holding an object while dancing and being able to track the dancerâ€™s hands and feet themselves so that a wide array of dance videos would be eligible for processing in our system. Lastly, we need to find a way to implement the Doppler effect on the final sound without distorting it.</para>
